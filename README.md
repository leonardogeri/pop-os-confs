# pop-os-confs

After 5 years using Ubuntu extensively as my main operational system, I've decided that, in 2023, Pop!Os will be my go-to OS choice. The productivity ecossystem was more-than-good-enough to convince me to give another chance for Pop!OS. 
One of my main concern with changing OS was to reconfigure my entire system built in 2 years of software development and data science related jobs. Lookinf for good examples on how to document my OS environment, I found [this thread on Reedit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pop_os/comments/ukm74z/share_your_popos_specific_config_github_repo/), which motivated me to start my own configuration repository.  

# Apps

## Software development and data science

- **R:** A powerful language for running stats models
- **Rstudio:** Best IDE for data science and ML in R
- **VS Code:** General use IDE for writing software 

## Music and video production
Audio production have always been a weaknesses of Linux distros. Since I'm a musician, I am concerned about the limitations of the OS. Those are the best apps I found for making music and video in Linux.

- **Reaper:** Incredibly powerful - and cheap - app for producing both audio and video.
